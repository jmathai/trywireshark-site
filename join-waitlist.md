We've already completed projects using the Wireshark method. We're now busy building the first prototype for others to do the same.

Why join the waitlist?

* Receive exclusive updates as we make progress with our prototype.
* Have the opportunity to test prototypes before they're made available for sale.
* Be among the first to be able to purchase Wireshark once it's ready for prime time.
* Get a glimpse into the process of bring a product like this to market. It's fun :)

## Behind the scenes

Building a product like Wireshark requires lots and lots of trial and error. Like the time we took a router to the wall and ended up being pleasantly suprised by the result. Except the dust, that sucked. We'll figure something out to make for easier clean up.
