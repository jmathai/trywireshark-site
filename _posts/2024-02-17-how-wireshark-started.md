title: How Wireshark Started
---

Hi. Wireshark is a new project that's well defined in the minds of the creators who have not had time to write about it yet.

They're working on it and this page will be the first public artifact which begins sharing what we're up to.

Until this page is updated, you can follow us on X at [@trywireshark](https://x.com/trywireshark).

In the meantime, here is a teaser.
